## Servings: 4 / Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cold water
- 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large (3 pounds) head cauliflower, trimmed, chopped small, including core
- Red pepper flakes
- 1 heaped teaspoon ground cumin
- 12 small (4 to 5-inch) or 8 medium (7-inch) corn or flour tortillas
- 1 lime, halved
- 1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 to 1 avocado, thinly sliced (to taste)
- 1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese
- Chopped fresh cilantro
- Hot sauce and/or pickled jalapeños

## Directions

Heat oven to 450 degrees F.

### Pickle Onion
Combine vinegar, water, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl.
Add onion and toss to coat. Set aside until needed.

### Cauliflower
Coat large baking sheet with 3 tablespoons olive oil.
Add cauliflower to pan, sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, red pepper flakes (to taste), and cumin and toss to coat, adding another tablespoon of oil if needed.
Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing pieces at the 15 minute mark so they take on a deep brown crisp on as many sides as possible.
Remove from oven and immediately squeeze the juice from half a lime over the tray.
Add black beans to pan, so they warm a bit before serving.

### Tortillas 
Meanwhile, heat your tortillas.
Wrap them tightly in foil and place the packet in the oven for 5 minutes.
For more color and texture, sometimes I char them first on the gas flame on the stove, or blister them in a dry pan.
Keep them warm in a covered dish until ready to assemble.

### Assembly
To assemble tacos, scoop cauliflower-bean mixture onto a warmed tortilla.
Add avocado, pickled red onion, cotija, cilantro, and hot sauce to taste.
Serve with remaining lime half in wedges. Eat right away.

## Notes
  Don’t throw your cauliflower core away; you can trim and dice it too and it will roast up deliciously here.
