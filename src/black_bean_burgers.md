This recipe should make about 8, 4-inch patties.

# Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked black beans (or two 16 oz cans)
- 1 small onion
- 3 medium sized potatoes
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 cup bread crumbs (or crushed crisp crackers)
- 2-3 eggs
- 1 tsp. cumin
- 1 tsp. oregano
- 1 tsp. curry powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. pepper
- Oil

Optional: any other veggies you'd like to throw in. Peppers are a nice addition.

# Instructions
1. Boil the black beans until they are soft, which could take upwards of two hours.
2. When beans are almost finished, peal and dice potatoes, onion, and garlic (and any additional veggies).
3. Fry potatoes in a small amount of oil until cooked through and golden on the outside.
4. Stir-fry onion and garlic, along with spices, in a small amount of oil.
5. Once beans are cooked, drain off remaining liquid.
6. Smash beans, and slightly smash the potatoes (depending on how big the chunks are).
7. Mix beans, potatoes, cooked veggies, and bread crumbs together.
8. Once mixed, add in beaten eggs one at a time (you want to end up with a gooey mixture that still holds its shape. Too many eggs and your mixture will be runny.)
9. Heat a small amount of oil in a frying pan, then using your hands, make patties and place into the oil.
10. Cook the burgers for 5-6 minutes per side or until dark and crispy. Each time you put new patties in the pan, be sure to add more oil.
