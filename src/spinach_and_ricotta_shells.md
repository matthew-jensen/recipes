# Ingredients

- 1 pound baby spinach, rinsed, or 2 pounds bunch spinach, stemmed and washed thoroughly
- Salt to taste
- 12 ounces giant pasta shells
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 to 2 garlic cloves, to taste, cut in half, green shoots removed
- 10 ounces ricotta cheese
- 1 egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons minced chives
- 2 ounces Parmesan, grated about 1/2 cup
- Freshly ground pepper
- 2 cups marinara sauce, preferably homemade

# Directions

- Blanche spinach
    - Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously.
    - Fill a bowl with ice water.
    - Blanch the spinach for no more than 20 seconds, just until wilted, and transfer to the ice water, then drain.
    - Squeeze out excess water.
- Cook Pasta
    - Bring the water in the pot back to a boil and add the pasta shells.
    - Cook al dente, about 10 minutes, and drain and toss with the olive oil. Set aside.
- Process Filling
    - Turn on a food processor fitted with the steel blade and drop in the garlic.
    - When the garlic is chopped and adhering to the sides of the bowl, stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
    - Add the spinach and pulse to chop finely.
    - Add the ricotta and the egg and process until well blended.
    - Add 1/3 cup of the Parmesan, the chives, and salt and pepper to taste.
    - Pulse until well blended.
- Assemble
    - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
    - Oil a large baking dish or two 2-quart dishes.
    - The shells should fit into the dish in one layer.
    - Fill each shell with a scant tablespoon of the filling.
    - Arrange in a single layer in the baking dish.
    - Top with the tomato sauce and cover the dish with foil.
- Bake
    - Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
- Serve
    - Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan, and serve.
