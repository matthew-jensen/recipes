## Preamble
This super easy one pot Beef & Mushroom Stroganoff is a delicious and comforting weeknight dinner that requires just a few ingredients. 

I used half ground beef and half mushrooms to stretch my pennies a bit further, but you could do all mushroom or all beef if you prefer. If you’re doing a vegetarian version with all mushrooms, use mushroom or vegetable broth to replace the beef broth.
Tips for “One Pot” Success

One pot recipes can be a bit tricky for some, so here are some pointers:

- Use heavy, thick cookware to make sure the ingredients heat evenly.
- Make sure the liquid is simmering the whole time the pasta is cooking. If the heat is too low, the pasta will just get gummy.
- Stir the pot to prevent sticking, but not too often or your risk breaking down the pasta.
- Use your judgement. If your pasta looks close to being cooked through, but there is too much liquid left in the skillet, let it finish simmering with the lid off. If the liquid is gone but your pasta is still not tender, add a splash more and continue to simmer.

Every piece of cookware and every range top is different, so one pot recipes are a bit like riding a bike. You have to feel it out and find the sweet spot for the equipment you’re using.


## Recipe 
- Total Cost: $7.20 recipe / $1.80 serving
- Prep Time: 10 mins
- Cook Time: 20 mins
- Total Time: 30 mins
- Servings: about 1.5 cups each

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp butter ($0.22)
- 2 cloves garlic ($0.16)
- 1/2 lb ground beef ($3.00)
- 8 oz fresh button mushrooms ($1.99)
- Freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
- 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.02)
- 2 cups beef Better Than Bouillon ($0.26)
- 8 oz wide egg noodles ($0.80)
- 1/3 cup sour cream ($0.50)
- handful fresh parsley for garnish (optional) ($0.20)

## Instructions

- Mince the garlic. Add the garlic and butter to a large pot or skillet and sauté over medium heat for about one minute, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until it is fully browned.
- While the beef is browning, slice the mushrooms. Once the beef has browned, add the sliced mushrooms and some freshly cracked pepper to the pot. Continue to sauté until the mushrooms are soft (about five minutes). Add the flour and sauté for about two minutes more. The flour will coat the bottom of the pot and this is okay.
- Add the beef broth to the pot and stir to dissolve the flour off of the bottom. Add the uncooked egg noodles. Place a lid on the pot and allow the liquid to come up to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, give the pot a stir, replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. Allow the pot to simmer for about 7-10 minutes, stirring the noodles and replacing the lid every couple of minutes. After 7-10 minutes the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed. Make sure the liquid is simmering the entire time. If not, increase the heat slightly.
- Once the noodles are tender, stir in the sour cream. Roughly chop a handful of parsley leaves and sprinkle over top. Serve hot.

## Rachel's tips
1. dont burn the garlic - start at heat 6.
2. chop the mushrooms before hand.
3. you can always add more water later - it's a one pot recipe.
4. use gluten free noodles.
5. add 1 Tsp of flour not 2.
6. add red pepper flakes.
7. when you first pour the both in, it doesnt cover the noodles. Covering the pan will soften the noodles and stirring covered them with liquid.
